`react-native-quick-crypto` is the **engine** that powers many high-performance crypto wallets. 

For standard wallet generation (BIP39), we provide a dedicated package **[`react-native-quick-bip39`](/docs/api/bip39)** that is built on top of these primitives.

## The Performance Bottleneck

Generating a wallet involves **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with **2048 iterations**. 
*   **Pure JS**: ~1500ms on older Android phones. ( Blocks UI )
*   **RNQC / RNQB**: ~20ms. ( Instant )

## Implementation

This guide shows how to generate a wallet using the official high-performance packages.

<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Installation

Install the core crypto library and the BIP39 utility.

```bash
npm install react-native-quick-crypto react-native-quick-bip39
```
</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Generate Mnemonic

Use `generateMnemonic` to create a new random 12-word or 24-word phrase. This uses the secure `randomBytes` from RNQC internally.

```ts
import { generateMnemonic } from 'react-native-quick-bip39';

// 12 words (128 bits entropy)
const sensitiveMnemonic = generateMnemonic(128); 
console.log(sensitiveMnemonic); // "orphan fresh utility..."
```
</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Mnemonic to Seed (The Heavy Lifting)

Convert the mnemonic words into a binary seed. This is the computationally expensive step that `react-native-quick-bip39` accelerates by ~100x using native C++ threads.

```ts
import { mnemonicToSeed } from 'react-native-quick-bip39';

const seed = await mnemonicToSeed(sensitiveMnemonic);
// buffer<...64 bytes...>
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can also use `mnemonicToSeedSync` if you are in a non-UI thread or need blocking execution, but async is recommended for best UX.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### 4. HD Key Derivation (HMAC-SHA512)

Once you have the seed, you derive child keys (for Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) using **HMAC-SHA512** from `react-native-quick-crypto`.

```ts
import { createHmac } from 'react-native-quick-crypto';

// A stripped-down example of BIP32 derivation
export function deriveChildKey(parentKey: Buffer, chainCode: Buffer, index: number) {
  const hmac = createHmac('sha512', chainCode);
  
  // Data = 0x00 || ParentKey || Index (BigEndian)
  const data = Buffer.alloc(37);
  data[0] = 0x00;
  parentKey.copy(data, 1);
  data.writeUInt32BE(index, 33);
  
  hmac.update(data);
  const I = hmac.digest();
  
  // Split I into Left (Private Key) and Right (Chain Code)
  const IL = I.subarray(0, 32);
  const IR = I.subarray(32);
  
  return { privateKey: IL, chainCode: IR };
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use `bip39` from npm?
Pure JavaScript libraries like `bip39` or `@scure/bip39` are excellent for the web (Node.js/Browser), but they are **slow on React Native** because they run cryptographic math in the JavaScript thread. 

`react-native-quick-bip39` is a drop-in replacement that delegates the heavy math to C++, making it usable for mobile apps without freezing the UI.
