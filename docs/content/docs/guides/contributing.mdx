We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `bun install` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```bash
bun i
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), or [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io), the tooling is built around [`bun`](https://bun.sh), so you'll have an easier time if you use `bun` for development.

### C++ Development

If you are using a VSCode-flavored IDE and the `clangd` extension, you can use the `scripts/setup_clang_env.sh` script to set up the environment for C++ development. This will create a `compile_commands.json` file in the root directory of the project, which will allow the IDE to provide proper includes, better code completion and navigation.  After that, add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "clangd.arguments": [
        "-log=verbose", 
        "-pretty", 
        "--background-index", 
        "--compile-commands-dir=${workspaceFolder}/packages/react-native-quick-crypto/"
    ],
}
```

### Running the Example App

While developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.

To develop in iOS, build the CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
pod install
```

To start the Metro bundler/packager:

```bash
bun start
```

To start the app:
```bash
bun ios # or android
```

### Native Files

-   To edit the Objective-C files, open `example/ios/QuickCryptoExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > react-native-quick-crypto`.
-   To edit the Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `margelo/quickcrypto` under `Android`.

## Code Quality

Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```bash
bun tsc
bun lint
bun format
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```bash
bun lint:fix
bun format:fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```bash
bun test
```

## Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

-   `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
-   `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
-   `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
-   `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
-   `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
-   `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation website is built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app) and Next.js. The source code for the documentation is located in the `docs` directory.

### Directory Layout

-   **`docs/content`**: Contains the MDX files for the documentation pages.
-   **`docs/components`**: React components used within the documentation (e.g., `CoverageTable.tsx`).
-   **`docs/data`**: Data files used by the components (e.g., `coverage.ts`).

### Adding a New Page

To add a new page to the documentation:

1.  Create a new `.mdx` file in `docs/content/docs/YOUR_SECTION/YOUR_PAGE.mdx`.
2.  Add the required frontmatter at the top of the file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Your Page Title
    description: A brief description of the page content.
    ---
    ```

3.  Register the new page in `docs/content/docs/YOUR_SECTION/meta.json` to ensure it appears in the sidebar navigation.



## Writing Documentation

For detailed guidelines on how to structure API pages, use components, and format your documentation, please see the [Writing Documentation](/docs/guides/writing-documentation) guide.

It covers:

-   Standard Page Structure (Theory, Class, Methods, Examples).
-   Table of Contents generation.
-   Frontmatter and Code Blocks.
-   Callouts and Alerts.

## Updating Documentation Coverage

The [`docs/data/coverage.ts`](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/blob/main/docs/data/coverage.ts) file tracks the implementation status of various cryptographic features. It is crucial to keep this file up-to-date so that users know what is supported.

> **Note:** This file feeds directly into the [Implementation Coverage](/docs/introduction/coverage) page. Updating this file automatically updates the coverage table on the website.

When you implement a new feature (or partially implement it), please find the corresponding entry in `coverage.ts` and update its status. Change `'missing'` to `'implemented'` or `'partial'`.

**Status Types:**

-   `'implemented'`: The feature is fully implemented and supported.
-   `'missing'`: The feature is not yet implemented.
-   `'partial'`: The feature is partially implemented. Please add a `note` explaining what is missing or supported.
-   `'not-in-node'`: The feature is specific to this library and does not exist in the standard Node.js crypto API.

**Example:**

```typescript
{
    name: 'MyNewFeature',
    status: 'implemented', // or 'partial', 'missing'
    note: 'Supports only specific options for now' // Optional
}
```

## Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

-   Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
-   Verify that linters and tests are passing.
-   Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
-   Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
-   If you add a new feature or change the status of an existing one, please update `docs/data/coverage.ts` to reflect the changes.
-   For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
