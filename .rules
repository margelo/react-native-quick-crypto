# React Native Quick Crypto

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context
- This is a react native project that offers cryptographic operations in native
code.
- It uses Nitro Modules to bridge JS & C++.
- Use the documentation of Nitro Modules if you have access locally to its llms.txt file.
- Part of the API strives to be a polyfill of the Node.js {crypto} module.
- The goal is to migrate 0.x of this library that uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 to now use OpenSSL 3.3 and modern C++ with Nitro Modules.

## Tech Stack
- React Native
- Typescript
- Nitro Modules
- C++ 20 and higher, modern
- OpenSSL 3.3 and higher
- TypeScript package manager is `bun` 1.2 or higher
- don't ask to run tests.  They have to be run in an example React Native app.

## Rules
- for C++ includes, do not try to add absolute or relative paths.  They have to be resolved by the build system.
- use smart pointers in C++
- use modern C++ features
- Attempt to reduce the amount of code rather than add more.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

# TypeScript Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Avoid any and enums; use explicit types and maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
- Suggest the optimal implementation considering:
  - Performance impact
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Testing strategy
- Code examples should follow Typescript best practices.

# React Best Practices

- Minimize the use of useEffect. They should be a last resort.
- Use named functions for useEffects with a meaningful function name. Avoiding adding unnecessary comments on effect behavior.

# Syntax & Formatting

- Use the function keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
