# React Native Quick Crypto

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context
- This is a react native project that offers cryptographic operations in native
code.
- It uses Nitro Modules to bridge JS & C++.
- Use the documentation of Nitro Modules if you have access locally to its llms.txt file.
- Part of the API strives to be a polyfill of the Node.js {crypto} module.
- The goal is to migrate 0.x of this library that uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 to now use OpenSSL 3.3and modern C++ with Nitro Modules.

## Tech Stack
- React Native
- Typescript
- Nitro Modules
- C++ 20 and higher, modern
- OpenSSL 3.3 and higher
- don't ask to run tests.  They have to be run in an example React Native app.

## Rules
- for C++ includes, do not try to add absolute or relative paths.  They have to be resolved by the build system.
- use smart pointers in C++
- use modern C++ features
