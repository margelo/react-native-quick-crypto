# Local Codebases

Use these instead of web searches for Node and 0.x branch:

- NodeJS code is located at `$HOME/dev/node`
  - use its `deps/ncrypto` code as a bible for crypto operations, and update this library's copy occasionally when we're implementing new features

- The old 0.x branch codebase is located at `$HOME/dev/rnqc/0.x`
