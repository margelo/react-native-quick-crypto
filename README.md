# ‚ö°Ô∏è react-native-quick-crypto

A fast implementation of Node's `crypto` module.

Unlike any other current JS-based polyfills, react-native-quick-crypto is written in C/C++ JSI and provides much greater performance - especially on mobile devices.
QuickCrypto can be used as a drop-in replacement for your Web3/Crypto apps to speed up common cryptography functions.

- üèéÔ∏è Up to 58x faster than all other solutions
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning fast implementation with pure C++ and JSI, instead of JS
- üß™ Well tested in JS and C++ (OpenSSL)
- üí∞ Made for crypto apps and Wallets
- üî¢ Secure native compiled cryptography
- üîÅ Easy drop-in replacement for [crypto-browserify](https://github.com/crypto-browserify/crypto-browserify) or [react-native-crypto](https://github.com/tradle/react-native-crypto)

For example, creating a Wallet using ethers.js uses complex algorithms to generate a private-key/mnemonic-phrase pair:

```ts
const start = performance.now();
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
const end = performance.now();
console.log(`Creating a Wallet took ${end - start} ms.`);
```

**Without** react-native-quick-crypto üê¢:

```
Creating a Wallet took 16862 ms
```

**With** react-native-quick-crypto ‚ö°Ô∏è:

```
Creating a Wallet took 289 ms
```

## Installation

<h3>
  React Native ¬†<a href="#"><img src="./img/react-native.png" height="15" /></a>
</h3>

```sh
yarn add react-native-quick-crypto
yarn add react-native-quick-base64
cd ios && pod install
```

<h3>
  Expo ¬†<a href="#"><img src="./img/expo.png" height="12" /></a>
</h3>

```sh
expo install react-native-quick-crypto
expo install react-native-quick-base64
expo prebuild
```

## Replace `crypto-browserify`

If you are using a library that depends on `crypto`, instead of polyfilling it with `crypto-browserify` (or `react-native-crypto`) you can use `react-native-quick-crypto` for a fully native implementation. This way you can get much faster crypto operations with just a single-line change!

You need to install `babel-plugin-module-resolver`, it's a babel plugin that will alias any imports in the code with the values you pass to it. It tricks any module that will try to import certain dependencies with the native versions we require for React Native.

```sh
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

In your `babel.config.js`, add the plugin to swap the `crypto`, `stream` and `buffer` dependencies:

```diff
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
+   [
+     'module-resolver',
+     {
+       alias: {
+         'crypto': 'react-native-quick-crypto',
+         'stream': 'stream-browserify',
+         'buffer': '@craftzdog/react-native-buffer',
+       },
+     },
+   ],
    ...
  ],
};
```

Then restart your bundler using `yarn start --reset-cache`.

## Usage

For example, to hash a string with SHA256 you can do the following:

```ts
import Crypto from 'react-native-quick-crypto';

const hashed = Crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update('Damn, Margelo writes hella good software!')
  .digest('hex');
```

## Android build errors

If you get an error similar to this:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:mergeDebugNativeLibs'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.MergeNativeLibsTask$MergeNativeLibsTaskWorkAction
   > 2 files found with path 'lib/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so' from inputs:
      - /Users/osp/Developer/mac_test/node_modules/react-native-quick-crypto/android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/jni/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so
      - /Users/osp/.gradle/caches/transforms-3/e13f88164840fe641a466d05cd8edac7/transformed/jetified-flipper-0.182.0/jni/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so
```

It means you have a transitive dependency where two libraries depend on OpenSSL and are generating a `libcrypto.so` file. You can get around this issue by adding the following in your `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
packagingOptions {
  // Should prevent clashes with other libraries that use OpenSSL
  pickFirst '**/libcrypto.so'
}
```

> This caused by flipper which also depends on OpenSSL

This just tells Gradle to grab whatever OpenSSL version it finds first and link against that, but as you can imagine this is not correct if the packages depend on different OpenSSL versions (quick-crypto depends on `com.android.ndk.thirdparty:openssl:1.1.1q-beta-1`). You should make sure all the OpenSSL versions match and you have no conflicts or errors.

## Limitations

As the library uses JSI for synchronous native methods access, remote debugging (e.g. with Chrome) is no longer possible. Instead, you should use [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com).
